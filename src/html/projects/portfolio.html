              <p class="h2">About</p>
              <p>This portfolio is a website where I showcase my favourite projects that I have done or am currently working on.
                In this page, we will discuss the features of this site and the web technologies used to make it all happen.
              </p>
              <p class="h2">Design</p>
              <p>The design of this site is meant to be simple and elegant, with clean and muted colours that do not take away 
                from the content of each page. I have implemented a top anchored nav bar centered in the middle of the page. 
                The basic layout of the site is based on this nav bar in that it is meant to resemble a printed page sitting 
                on a table. I felt that the stretched/fullscreen layout that some sites use did not fit this site, and a 
                "printed page" layout was more appropriate. All of the features have been implemented with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 
                Bootstrap, and for the contact page, jQuery and PHP.
                <br><br>
                Responsiveness is a priority for this site. All the images, nav bar hover animations, and other graphics are all 
                nice and pretty, but they hinder the responsiveness of the site and engagement of the user. I have used several 
                techniques and strategies to keep lag to a minimum.
                <br><br>
                Firstly, the nav bar is designed to auto resize when the browser window is smaller than 850 pixels or when the 
                page is viewed on a mobile device. When the screen is smaller than 680 pixels, all buttons but the home button 
                are relocated to a dropdown menu at the right of the nav bar. These two features are written in plain HTML and CSS 
                without Bootstrap or any other framework. The animations do not consume many resourses and thus provide an 
                engaging experience to the user at minimal cost. 
                <br><br>
                Secondly, the site uses the Bootstrap framework for most of the animations, the fluid resizing and such, due to 
                the simple and readable html file that results when Bootstrap is used, and due to its performance. Bootstrap 
                'columns' and 'rows' are used to organize content on the webpage in a clean manner that is pleasing to the eye.
                These colums and rows also rearrange content on the screen to account for different screen sizes. Bootstrap also 
                provides modern buttons and input fields which are used in the contact form.
                <br><br>
                Thirdly, image compression and resizing is used. The images when photographed were around 20+ MB each, which is 
                far from ideal in a webpage, especially one designed for mobile use. After compression, each photo is around 
                20 - 50 KB with quality loss that is hardly noticable. Each photo has been resized to approximately the actual 
                size that it is displayed at in the web browser. This allows for much lighter photos with minimal quality loss 
                because they will not be displayed at higher resolutions anyway. They have also been saved in the JPEG format 
                due to its many advantages with respect to compression.
