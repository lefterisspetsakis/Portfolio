              <p class="h2">About</p>
              <p>GyroSnake is a snake game that is played on a dot matrix display. It runs on an ATmega328 (an atmel chip) 
                and is controlled by a gyroscope.
              </p>
              <p class="h2">Progress</p>
              <p>GyroSnake is currently in development and is available on GitHub. This is a project that I started recently, 
                so not much code has been written yet. However, I would like to share these designs anyway for the benefit 
                of anyone wishing to use them in their projects or for anyone who is simply interested. Enjoy!
              </p>
              <p class="h2">Design</p>
              <p>The design I am implementing is one that incorporates fundamental concepts in real time operating systems 
                such as event queues and task queues. It also uses two decoder IC's (integrated circuit) that take 3 digital 
                signals as input and turn on the corresponding output pin. These are used to drive the display because the 
                atmel chip does not have enough pins to send signals to each display pin.
              </p>
              <p class="h3">Hardware Design</p>
              <p>The circuit used in GyroSnake is simpler than it appears. It consists of the gyro connected directly 
                to the atmel, a dot matrix display connected with two decoders and a pair of inverters for the one decoder, 
                and a simple voltage regulation module. Only one decoder needs to be inverted because when one decoder is 
                sending a HIGH signal, the other should send a LOW (essentially a ground for the LED being lit up). There are two 
                inverters because each one has 6 output pins while the dot matrix needs 7, so one extra inverter is used.
                <br><br>
                The idea behind the design is based on the following concept. At any given moment, it is impossible to display 
                any two LEDs on the display without displaying 4 to create a rectangle. The reason for this is that all anodes 
                are connected together in their respective rows and all cathodes are similarily connected to their respective columns. 
                This is done to reduce the number of pins required to drive the display. However, if you turn on B3 and D6 for example, 
                B6 and D3 will also light up.
                <br><br>
                To solve this problem, we cycle through the LEDs, turning them on or off one by one, at a high enough frequency 
                that the human eye will not notice. This is where the design of the software becomes important.
              </p>
              <p class="h3">Software Design</p>
              <p>The design behind the code is based on the concept where it is impossible to turn on any two LEDs at the exact 
                same time without turning on two other LEDs that form a rectangle. We discussed that we need to cycle through the 
                LEDs fast enough that the human eye cannot notice that we are displaying them one by one.
                <br><br>
                To implement this in C++/Arduino, we need a few key elements. The first is a clock. On the atmel chip, this is 
                fairly simple if we use the arduino library. We can use the millis() function to measure the elapsed time between 
                events. This means that we need a way to keep track of events, which is where the event queue comes in. The event 
                queue is used to store pending events that are submitted by various modules such as the GameManager or the 
                directional input module (controls snake movement). The next element we need is a task queue. This is very similar 
                to the event queue, however the event queue holds 'events' which we will define as things that happen spontaneously 
                such as user input, and the task queue holds 'tasks' which we will define to be things that occur regularly such as 
                updating the display. There are a few other things we need, but these are the fundamental ones.
              </p>
              <p class="h4">Event Queue</p>
              <p>As we discussed above, the event queue is used to track events which occur spontaneously. These events are 
                typically submitted by modules that accept input (gyro module) and are processed by modules that provide output 
                (display module). Event queues are important because there will be times in the program where an event will take 
                two or more clock cycles to process and in the mean time another event will be submitted. Without an event queue, 
                missed inputs may be noticed, depending of course on the implementation. The event queue prevents missed events 
                to a certain extent by storing the events and allowing other processes to continue while the events in the queue 
                are being processed. This may increase input lag slightly, but this is hardly noticable, especially in our system 
                where it is not controlled by tactile keyboard inputs that the user can feel.
              </p>
              <p class="h4">Task Queue</p>
              <p>The task queue is similar to the event queue, however it is strictly for things that occur regularly (usually 
                lower level operations). In this game it is used for tracking the display updates, checking the gyroscope for 
                changes (if there is a change, an event is sent to the event queue), and other little operations such as incrementing 
                the score, and updating the frame.
