Hey!
<br><br>
Iâ€™m a Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I am enrolled in the CO-OP program which allows students to work at various great companies throughout the undergraduate years. Some of my more notable projects include making a mashup maker while working for Rave Media Inc., and creating an Arduino snake game that uses multiplexing, and real time operating systems.
<br><br>
My first position was at Rave Media Inc. as a Software Engineer, where we developed an automated mashup maker. It takes any two of your favourite hit songs from YouTube and automatically analyzes them, cuts them up, and rearranges them in a musical way that showcases the best bits of each. Currently I am working for Saint Elizabeth Health Care doing Telecom administration. I have also written a few natural language processing scripts that manage the contents of our databases.
<br><br>
I have worked on MIR systems (Music Information Retrieval) while developing algorithms that do beat detection, musical segmentation, key detection, and more. I have also dealt with RTOS (Real-Time Operating Systems) while building the GyroSnake game. This is a personal project of mine and it uses multiplexing to display 35 LEDs using only 6 output pins.
<br><br>
I have also done some web development, creating a little JavaScript game, and this website. This website is written mostly from scratch and incorporates Bootstrap to make it enjoyable on any device. The JavaScript game is a side scrolling jumping game where I hosted it off a Raspberry Pi.
<br><br>
A little about my personal life: I am a person who enjoys creating things very much, who enjoys making others happy, and who enjoys playing the trumpet. I have played in many venues across Toronto and in Greece, and have played in many semi-professional orchestras and jazz/funk ensembles. I have a younger bigger brother who plays football. My parents are from Greece and we go back regularly to visit our grandparents and family. I also enjoy cars and drive a manual.
<br><br>
Want to work together? Feel free to contact me. I enjoy collaborating with people to create amazing things, and would love to hear from you!
